Kafka is open source, distributed, event streaming platform. Kafka is designed to handle data that is constently being generated 
and need to be processed as it comes in,without delay.

Zookeper - Zookeper monitor the health of kafka cluster.

Kafka Broker - a dedicated sapce on server or a server on which kafka is running.
Kafka Producer - A part of kafka which put the data into cluster
Kafka Consumer - A part of kafka which retrive the data from the kafka cluster.   
Kafka Connect -  To retrive or conuse the data from the other sources.
Kafka Stream -   which is used for the data transformation.

Command to run kafka

Note - Go to the kafka/bin/window folder and then run below command


To start Zookeper - zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties

To start kafka server - kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties

To create a new topic - kafka-topics.bat --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 3

To start kafka Producer - kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-topic

To start Kafka Consumer - kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic my-topic --from-beginning






Kafka Topic - Kafka topic is a type of container in which similar events are store.
Partition - A topic is split into several parts which are known as the partition of the topic. Partition is where actually the message is located.


Note - We can send message into partition with key and without key. When sending the data with key, odering will be maintained as they will be in 
       the same partition.
       Without key we can not gurantee the odering the message as consumer poll the message from all the partition at the same time.4


Note - When a consumer group reads messages from the topic, each member of the group maintains its own offset and updates it as it consumes message.

__consumer_offset - __consumer_offset is a built-in topic in Apache Kafka that  keeps track of the latest offset committed for each partition of each
			  consumer group.
			  The topic is internal to the Kafka cluster and not meant to be read or writtem to directly by clients. Instead, the offdet information
			  is stored in the topic and updated by the Kafka broker to reflect the position of each consumer in each partiotion.

			  The information in __consumer_offset is used by kafka to maintain the reliability of the consumer groups and to ensure that message are
			  not lost or duplicated.

Note - When a consumer joins a consumer group, it send sa join request to the group cordinator. the group coordinator determines which partition the consumer
       should assigned based on the number of consumers in the group and the current assignment of partition to the consumers.
	 The group coordinator then sends a new assignment of the partiotion to the consumer, which includes the set of partiotns that the cosumer is responsible
       for consuming. And consumer starts consumng data from the assigned partiotions.
